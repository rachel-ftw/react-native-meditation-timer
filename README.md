## Development Journal

**Monday May 22nd, 2017:**
Toward the end of last week I got a bit ahead of myself.  Today I'm rolling back the project and going through in a more methodical way. First: make the front end. Second: make the logic & wire up redux.  Having a process helps me to focus, if ADD wins then I end up with a half working jumble.


**Wednesday May 17th, 2017:**
Feeling proud. Picked up React Native for the first time on Monday. Started looking at redux at 4pm yesterday. Today I got basic information to pass through multiple reducers. It doesn't have much of a front end, but it's working. Months ago I wouldn't have known how to Frankenstein my way through this, I would have gotten blocked.  Today I was able to go through all the different tutorials, pull out the parts that made sense and concoct something that fit my project.

It's a great feeling to notice the ways in which you've technically grown.
