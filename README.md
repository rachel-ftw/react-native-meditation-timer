Feeling proud. Picked up React Native for the first time on Monday. Started looking at redux at 4pm yesterday. Today I've got basic information being passed around through multiple reducers. It doesn't have much of a front end, but it's working. Months ago I wouldn't have known how to frankenstein my way through this, I would have gotten blocked.  Today I was able to go through all the different tutorials, pull out the parts that made sense and concoct something that fit my project.

It's a really great feeling to notice the ways in which you've technically grown.
