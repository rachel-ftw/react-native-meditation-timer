## Development Journal

**Thursday May 25th, 2017:**
Beasted research and job applications today.

**Wednesday May 24rd, 2017:**
I stayed out too late last night, a rare occurrence, but suffered the consequences in the morning. My brain was fuzzy af and I couldn't bring myself to be very useful, despite hours of trying. By the grace of coffee I survived until lunch, when I regained consciousness as a human. Once my brain agreed to cooperate, I had a great afternoon completing a couple of the screens of the app and starting to understand navigation in the React Native world.
Adventures around every corner.

**Tuesday May 23rd, 2017:**
I had an interview today and spent much of my time applying to jobs and doing busy work to support that process.  It is occasionally nice to take a break from coding to do admin.

**Monday May 22nd, 2017:**
Toward the end of last week I got a bit ahead of myself.  Today I'm rolling back the project and going through in a more methodical way. First: make the front end. Second: make the logic & wire up redux.  Having a process helps me to focus, if ADD wins then I end up with a half working jumble.

Feeling proud. Picked up React Native for the first time on Monday. Started looking at redux at 4pm yesterday. Today I got basic information to pass through multiple reducers. It doesn't have much of a front end, but it's working. Months ago I wouldn't have known how to Frankenstein my way through this, I would have gotten blocked.  Today I was able to go through all the different tutorials, pull out the parts that made sense and concoct something that fit my project.

It's a great feeling to notice the ways in which you've technically grown.
